                Machine Learning - Simple Linear Regression
                
In this I have implemented the most basic algo of machine learning  - Simple linear regression.
In Mathematical Form y=a+bx where y is a dependent variable and x is a independent variable.
I have a dataset containing experience of employees and their salaries.
Now, Our task is to predict the salaries of employees on the basis of their experience.

               Machine Learning - Multi Linear regression
               
In real world scenario the outcome depends on many factors not a single factor.
for multiple dependencies we can use multi linear regression model.
Mathematical form y=a + b1x1 + b2x2 + b3x3....+ bnxn. where x1....xn are n factors on which y depend.
On the basis of b1...bn value higher the value of b more it affects the y as compare to other factors. a is called intercept when none of the factors is there then it would be the value.
Now, In my dataset i have data of 50 startups whose profit depends on many factors such as RnD, Adminstration, Marketing etc.
As an investor in which section i should invest to get maximum profit.
